Telecommunication service providers are also competing to provide various types of telecommunication services with various conveniences and benefits for customers. In every business,  company always wants to keep its customers always using its services, as well as in the telecommunications industry. Understanding customer behavior through data will certainly help a company take business efforts in retaining its customers. Therefore, it is important for a company to analyze customer churn as a basis for making business strategies to retain customers.
