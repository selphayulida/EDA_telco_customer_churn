# Understanding Customer Churn Behavior in Telecom Industry by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
In the digital era that is growing rapidly today, everyone certainly cannot escape the need for telecommunications (smartphones). Telecommunication service providers are also competing to provide various types of telecommunication services with various conveniences and benefits for customers. In every business,  company always wants to keep its customers always using its services, as well as in the telecommunications industry. Understanding customer behavior through data will certainly help a company take business efforts in retaining its customers. Therefore, it is important for a company to analyze customer churn as a basis for making business strategies to retain customers.

Customer churn is a business metric that measures the number of customers who have stopped using the company's products or services. Every company certainly wants to reduce or prevent customer churn and increase customer lifetime value (CLV). In this mini-project, I used a dataset from Kaggle which provided customer information data from a Telcom company and did a deep-dive analysis in the EDA process to get a better understanding of the data.
